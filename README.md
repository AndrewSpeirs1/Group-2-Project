## This project looks at the BMI distribution in Scotland from 2013 - 2016. The report contains a introduction, exploratory analysis, formal analysis answering the 2 question of interest and a conclusion.

## Introduction - BMI distribution and obesity have health risks and pose significant challenges to public health. Understanding the trends and determinants of Body Mass Index (BMI) is crucial for designing effective interventions and policies aimed at reducing obesity rates and improving overall population health. Our analysis focuses on two key research questions: - Has the body mass index (BMI) in Scotland changed over the given years (2013 - 2016) of the Scottish Health Survey? - Are there any differences in the BMI distribution by age, gender, socio-economic status or lifestyle factors?
